Q4: What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why?
Answer: ReferenceError: result is not defined
Reason: Declaring a variable with the let keyword provides the variable 
        with what is known as block scope. This means that it can only 
        be accessed within the block it is defined in, unlike the var keyword. 

Q5: What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
Answer: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
Reason: The const keyword gives its variable the same scope as the let keyword. Declaring a variable with the const prevents it from being reassigned after it is assigned for the first time, much like the final keyword in Java, 
        making it useful for declaring constants in your programs
