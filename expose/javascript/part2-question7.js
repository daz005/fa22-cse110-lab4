Q7: ^^^ WWhat will happen at line 14 and why? 
    If the code causes an error, explain why. ^^^

Answer: print out 150

Reason: Declaring a variable with the let keyword provides 
        the variable with what is known as block scope. This 
        means that it can only be accessed within the block 
        it is defined in, unlike the var keyword.
